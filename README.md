# Virtual Machine

##Setting up your local coding environment

What is a virtual machine
A virtual machine (VM) is a software emulation of a physical computer. It allows you to run an operating system (OS) within another OS, creating an isolated environment where you can install and run software as if it were a separate physical machine. VMs are commonly used for testing, development, and running multiple OS environments on a single physical machine.

What is Vagrant
Vagrant is a tool used for managing and creating development environments. It simplifies the setup and configuration of VMs or containers for various projects. Vagrant uses configuration files (Vagrantfiles) to define the settings of the virtual environment, making it easier to create consistent development environments across different machines.

Who wrote Vagrant
Vagrant was created by Mitchell Hashimoto, who developed it to streamline the process of setting up development environments and ensuring consistency across different systems.

What is Ubuntu
Ubuntu is a popular open-source Linux-based operating system. It's known for its ease of use, regular updates, and community support. Ubuntu is widely used in personal computing and server environments due to its stability and user-friendly interface.
What does “Ubuntu” mean
The word "Ubuntu" originates from the Nguni Bantu language and carries a philosophical meaning often translated as "I am because we are" or "humanity towards others." It represents an African philosophy emphasizing community, interconnectedness, and compassion.

How to use VMs with Vagrant
To use VMs with Vagrant, you typically create a configuration file (Vagrantfile) that specifies the details of the VM, such as the OS, resources, and software installations required for your development environment. Once the Vagrantfile is set up, using simple command-line instructions (vagrant up, vagrant halt, vagrant destroy, etc.), Vagrant manages the VM lifecycle, making it easy to maintain and share development environments.

What does the command uname do
The uname command in Linux-based systems retrieves system information. Adding certain flags like -a or -s, -r, -v, -m, -p, or -o modifies the output to display specific information about the system, such as the kernel version, hardware architecture, operating system, and more. For example, uname -a displays all available system information.
